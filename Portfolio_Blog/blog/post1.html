    <p class="entry1"> <b>Entry #1.</b><br>   (This is a blog to wrtie about the things I want to do at BCIT:) <br><br>
        I enrolled into BCIT's Computer Information techonlogies course not because I wanted to do CIT in the future, nor was it because I had any plan in mind
        I simply didn't know what to do at the end of my grade 12 year and was pressured to do pick one of my very limiting options. If I had the time to choose
        what I was gonna do coming out of highschool I would have simply just chose to take a gap year, working part time and figuring out something on the side.
        Unfortunatly I wasn't able to choose this option as my part time job only offered 5 hours of work, in the lunch service. Either I would continue going to
        work with 5 more hours at dinner service or I could further my education. I chose the option of trades as I quickly realized that at the end of any University
        or College, it would still result in job hunting. BCIT having good connections to companies and getting good job recommendations, upon good grades, it would 
        simply give me what i was looking for. I do regret not going to university for a less condensed ciriculum, I also wished to join more clubs with a more flexible
        schedule. I however, didn't have anything i wanted to major in besides Japanese or Animation. My parents aren't really supportive of me majoring in japanese,
        and to apply for 2D animation at an univeristy would require a portfolio that i had not yet prepared. Drawing is something I'm very passionate about and could see myself
        doing it for a long time in the forseable future. With no options left I went to apply to CIT with little to no knowledge of technologies. I merely saw this 
        as an opportunity to learn something new while figuring something out on the side. I'm not very particular about learning how to code, but in a world that's
        always developing in technologies, I though it would be great to educate myself in something that would play a big role in my life in the future. The more
        I understand the better it is. Newer and newer technologies will always develop, best way to prepare myself is to educate myself, and who knows, I might find
        something important along the way.
