    <p class="entry1"> <b>Entry #2.</b><br>   (This is a blog to wrtie about the things I want to do after BCIT:) <br><br>
       After I finish my diploma of CIT at BCIT, a 2 year program, I have considered self learning a bit more, or enrolling into CST(Computer Systems Technologies)
       . One of the couple things I plan on doing after the program is probably getting a job related to the skillsets I gained from the Progarm. Depending on whether
       I get into Coop at BCIT, a way to "earn while you learn" was one of the couple of things that first caught my eye when people from BCIT advertised it back at my
       highschool. A way to make money while you learn was very inticing and captivating. Although, I didn't realize how difficult it would be to get into Coop, because
       it's kind of like a competition with everyone else for a position. You apply when you're at your third term and attempt to get one of the 20 seats avaliable. At
       first I thought my odds would be ok, until I saw how many students enrolled in the program, the skill levels, and detication of others wasn't something I could
       overlook or attempt to overcome. There are a handful of students are very good at their work and try their very hardest in the program. I didn't realize how
       important this was to others, and makes me question my position here at BCIT as a CIT student. I'm not very deticated, not the most determined, heck I didnk't apply
       because I had a specific goal in mind here. I didn't even want to be here. Questions like "Is it really ok for me to be here" went across my mind. I don't try my
       hardest when it comes to assignments or exams, I procrastinate a crap ton, and am not the best teammate to have during group projects. I spend most my time trying
       to catch up to most assignments. I do realize that I have my own goals as well, and could interfere with others, but i guess this is where i have to be a bit selfish
       with my decisions. What I'm looking for is to obtain a job that pays 25-30 dollars an hour so I could leave my current job, and trying to find something on the side,
       another means of income that can get me far in life and live comfortably. I just hope my half-ass way of doing things is enough to get me that job, I don't like the one 
       I have now, because it really relies on customer service and people are needy, they're annoying, and some of them act very entitled. I don't like serving people
       and don't find any joy or fun in doing so, it's just my only source of income right now, so even if I have to omit my weekends for income, I do. Until I get that job
       I'm stuck in a place I don't want to be. It's scary to me how most my future relies on this diploma, yet I can't find the motivation to try my very hardest. Is it because it's
       something I'm not passionate about like drawing, or am I simply that kind of person who doesn't get much motivation from doing things.
